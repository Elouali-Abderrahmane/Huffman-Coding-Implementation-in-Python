# Huffman-Coding-Implementation-in-Python

## Overview 🔍
This Python implementation demonstrates Huffman coding—a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies. More frequent characters get shorter codes, optimizing overall storage/transmission efficiency.

## Key Features 🚀
Frequency table generation

Priority queue (min-heap) for tree construction

Recursive code generation via DFS traversal

Custom HeapNode class for tree representation

Example usage with text analysis
